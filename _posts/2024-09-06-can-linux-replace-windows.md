As someone who just casually lurks around on the World Wide Web, I've seen over time people advising other people to "switch to Linux". Yes, **Linux has points where it is actually good in comparison with Windows**, but in its current state I really cannot advise one to "switch to Linux" or anything, maybe power users or anything for something. I am speaking as someone who has used Linux more as their main OS for the past six months. Just hear me out.

Let's start with the fact that **Linux doesn't support as many apps as Windows does**. Average developers will choose to rather make their software only for Windows as that is the majority of the desktop market share, and Windows obviously ain't gonna drop in market share anytime soon. This is where we get one of the main reasons why people will just not drop Windows altogether. Another reason would be simply that the average Joe only knows about Windows, all they use their computers for is browsing the internet etc.

Yes, there are solutions like Wine to run Windows applications in Linux, but often they're hit or miss. Alternatives may be either good, or worse.

Even the apps that natively support Linux, some are harder to install and/or get the comfort from Windows. I'll talk about this later in the blog post.

Actually, to get a better picture of my realizations, I will do this differently. When I was initially recommended Linux in 2015, it was at a time my PC at that time would have kept BSOD'ing while running Windows. **So I went to make my first Linux-Windows dualboot, getting Linux Mint.** Indeed, I haven't experienced any BSOD-level issue running Linux. Essentially, Linux was like a live-saver when using that PC. Over time, I've done other dualboots on various computers over the years, starting from another Linux Mint dualboot toward Ubuntu flavors, going from Ubuntu MATE to Xubuntu and then going to Kubuntu now in 2024.

In the history I can remember, the Kubuntu dualboot I made this year was the first time I really actively wanted to use Linux. That way I've been able to get better knowing as to what works and what doesn't, what is working well and what's not etc. Even more I've learnt from two other dualboots I made over the summer and into early fall with Debian Stable, one on my Intel IdeaPad, and another on my AMD IdeaPad which replaced the former as my main machine.
